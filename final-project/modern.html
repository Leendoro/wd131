            <h2>Modern Day Sodas</h2>
            <p>Soft drinks have come a long way since their early days as medicinal tonics. Today, the soda industry is a massive global market, with numerous brands and flavors catering to a wide range of tastes and preferences.</p>
            <p>In recent years, there has been a significant shift towards healthier options. Many consumers are now seeking out low-calorie, low-sugar, and natural ingredient alternatives. This has led to the rise of diet sodas, sparkling water, and beverages made with natural sweeteners like stevia.</p>
            <p>Brands like Coca-Cola and Pepsi continue to dominate the market, but there are also many new players making a name for themselves with innovative flavors and marketing strategies. Craft sodas, which focus on unique ingredients and artisanal production methods, have also gained popularity.</p>
            <p>Additionally, sustainability has become a key concern in the industry. Companies are investing in eco-friendly packaging and production methods to reduce their environmental impact. This includes the use of recyclable materials and efforts to reduce plastic waste.</p>
            <p>Overall, the modern soda landscape is diverse and dynamic, constantly evolving to meet the changing demands and preferences of consumers.</p>
